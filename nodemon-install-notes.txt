start server using:
$ node index.js

for suppose you made some changes in application script.
now you will have to close the server and restart the server using above command.

but to save the hassle, you can install nodemon module globally,
$ npm install nodemon -g

you can start your server using:
$ nodemon index.js

this will automatically update the server with any changes in application script.

however, an error would occur that nodemon is not recognized.
so for this, you have to set the PATH under user variables,
to the output of following command:
$ npm config get prefix
>> C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\npm

after setting this another error might occur:
nodemon : File C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\npm\nodemon.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.

this would get resolved by running the following command on PowerShell:
$ Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

to revert this action, use the the following command:
$ Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser
